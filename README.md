The Homework for Applied Mathematics in Computer Science
========================================================
1. The one dimension regression: use the polynomial function fitting the sin function
2. The PCA algorithm: Reduce high-dimension to low-dimension using the 389 handing writing three digital picture as samples
3. The EM algorithm: The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method to find the maximum likelihood
4. The LM algorithm: An non-linear optimization algorithm between Newton's Method and Gradient Descent Method
5. SVM: Support Vector Machine
