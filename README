This project is used for my homework in Applied Math in Computer Science.
Currently,It contains the following contexts:
==============================================================================
1. The one dimension regression: use the polynomial function fitting the sin function

2. The PCA algorithm: reduce high-dimension to low-dimension using the 389 handwriting three digital picture as smaple

3. The EM algorithm: The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative
method to find the maximum likelihood. In this case, it used to classfy the
d-deimension points into different groups.
===============================================================================
